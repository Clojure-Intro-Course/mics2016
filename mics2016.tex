\section*{\centering Abstract}
Error messages are the only form of response that programmers get from malfunctioning programs. More experienced programmers often develop intuition about what error messages actually mean, but novices only have the content of the error message. Our research focuses on two functional programming languages in the Lisp family, their current or potential use in introductory CS classes, and specifically on the quality of their error messages for beginner CS students. 

The languages we will be comparing are a subset of Racket called beginning student language, and Clojure. Beginning student language is a language designed for introductory students using the “How to Design Programs 2” curriculum, with error messages that are designed for novices. Clojure is a Lisp built on top of the Java programming language which better supports concurrent and parallel programming and has been rapidly gaining popularity in industry. However, Clojure was not developed with beginner programmers in mind: its native error messages are often just Java error messages that don’t make sense to programmers without Java background. Our previous work with Clojure has built an alternative error messages system that we think may be more useful to beginner CS students. 

Our work is a part of the ClojurEd project which aims to use Clojure to teach an introductory CS course. One of the project goals is to provide introductory students with understandable error messages. We attempt to achieve this goal by rephrasing Java errors in terms that are familiar to new Clojure programmers. As a simple example, we replace references to specific Java numeric types, such as “int” and “double”, with just the term “number”. The next stage of the project is to evaluate how well the new messages work for beginner programmers. 

In order to evaluate how helpful our error messages are to beginners, we have designed a usability study comparing the proposed and standard Clojure error messages to each other and to Racket error messages. There are very few published usability studies of error messages and very few guidelines for evaluating quality of error messages, thus we have developed methodology for comparing error messages in two similar languages. We evaluate the effectiveness of our error messages by giving students, who are familiar with Racket, erroneous code in both Racket and Clojure. We will then observe how the information presented within the error messages helps them to correct the erroneous code. Effectiveness of error messages will primarily be measured by the number of code smales successfully corrected by students, as well as the number of attempts is takes a student to correct the errors. 

In this paper we present the details of the study and the approaches to developing code samples that allow us to compare error messages systems. We also present and discuss preliminary results of the usability study.
